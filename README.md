# CatchUpTo.Me

This repository contains the STATIC assets for CatchUpTo.Me

The code lives in Dark at https://darklang.com/a/avdi-catchupto (which you can't unless access you're Avdi)

TODO: get Jess access
TODO: can other people read the code?

Public site URL: https://avdi-catchupto.builtwithdark.com (for now)

# Deploy

We assume you're running everything in a container, as defined by the Dockerfile. 

$DARK_PASS needs to be set on the host to Avdi's password. You will have to bribe Avdi with quite a lot of pie for this.
